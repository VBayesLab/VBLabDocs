# **Code examples**

Our code examples are short, focused demonstrations of how to perform Bayesian Approximation using Variational Bayes techiniques discussed in the [VB tutorial paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340006729_A_practical_tutorial_on_Variational_Bayes).

We also provide code examples to replicate the experimental results shown in our research papers.
